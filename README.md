## Question :question:

File `server\api\call-function.js`

```
  // QUESTION - how to call this without the full URL?
  // ‚ùå this does NOT work locally
  // const whatever = await $fetch('/.netlify/functions/hello')

  // when running `netfliy dev` this will work if I use this full URL
  // http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello

  // how is this supposed to work in production? Do I something like BASE_URL?

  const whatever = await $fetch('https://nuxt3-netlify-functions.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hello')
  console.log("üê•üê•", whatever)
  return whatever
```
